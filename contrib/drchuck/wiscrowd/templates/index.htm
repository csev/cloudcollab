<p>You are now successfully logged in using LTI Launch - this system has the following tools:</p>
<ul>
          {% for tool in tools %}
          <li>
            <a href="{{tool.portalpath}}">{{tool.title}}</a>
            <a href="{{tool.directpath}}" target=_new 
               style="color: gray; font-size: small;">(fragment-only)</a>
            <p>{{ tool.desc }}
          </li>
          {% endfor %}
</ul>
<hr/>
<p style="color: gray; font-size: small;">
The "fragment-only" option shows the tool without any portal navigation.  This is how it
will look when it is embedded into another LMS.  You can embed this tool into any LMS
which suports Simple LTI by using the fragment url with the proper password.  The fragment
url handles both the LTI web service protocol interactions as well as 
the actual tool fragment and interaction when the tool is running in the browser.

Here is the information we know about you from the launch.  
User: {{username}} Course: {{coursename}} Role: {{role}}
</p>
<p>
The following is a dump of the output of the LTI run-time
data structures.  It is helpful in case you want to 
look are doing development and want to look 
more deeply into some of the information available
to your LTI tool at
run-time.  The most important bits of this are
available as convienence methods on the LTI object.

Welcome to the demo of the CloudCollab framework for building applications using
Simple IMS Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI).
</p>
<p>
This looks like an LMS - but really it is intended to be 
a collection of tools launched from another LMS using the
IMS SimpleLTI protocol.  
</p>
<p>
If you want to simulate an LTI Launch click <a href="/lti_test">here</a>.
<p>
The IMS Learning Tools Interoperability and Simple LTI are being developed by the
<a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/" target="_new">www.imsglobal.org</a>.  If you are interested
in standards and interoperability for teaching and learning technology you should become
involved in IMS.
