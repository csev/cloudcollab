- this system has the following tools:</p>
<ul>
          {% for tool in tools %}
          <li>
            <a href="{{tool.portalpath}}">{{tool.title}}</a>

            <p>{{ tool.desc }}
          </li>
          {% endfor %}
</ul>
<hr/>
<p style="color: gray; font-size: small;">
The "fragment-only" option shows the tool without any portal navigation.  This is how it
will look when it is embedded into another LMS.  You can embed this tool into any LMS
which suports Simple or Basic LTI by using the fragment url with the proper password.  The fragment
url handles both the LTI web service protocol interactions as well as 
the actual tool fragment and interaction when the tool is running in the browser.

Here is the information we know about you from the launch.  
User: {{username}} Course: {{coursename}} Role: {{role}}
</p>
<p>
The following is a dump of the output of the LTI run-time
data structures.  It is helpful in case you want to 
look are doing development and want to look 
more deeply into some of the information available
to your LTI tool at
run-time.  The most important bits of this are
available as convienence methods on the LTI object.

Welcome to the demo of the CloudCollab application which uses the Tsugi framework for building 
applications using IMS Learning Tools Interoperability (Simple LTI and Basic LTI).  Tsugi applications
can also be launched and accept identity from Facebook.
