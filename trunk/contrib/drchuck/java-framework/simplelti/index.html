<h1>IMS Simple Learning Tools Interoperability - Java Producer</h1>
<p>
This is a minimal reference implementation of the IMS Simple Learning 
Tools Interoperability protocol as described at
<a href=http://simplelti.appspot.com/>simplelti.appspot.com</a>.
Simple LTI is not a formal standard - it is just an engineering specification
to explore the architecure of IMS Learning Tools Interoperability and inform
the formal standards process around that specification.
</p>
<p>
This is distributed as a Java Web Application (war file) which can be dropped 
into a servlet container.  The source code is included in the WEB-INF/classes
folder so that it is self contained and self-deploying.  There is a README.txt
in that folder describing developer issues.
</p>
<p>
This software implements the <i>producer</i> aspects of IMS Simple LTI.  
It does not include any database persistence - it simply includes the 
code to comply with the SimpleLTI launch protocol.  This software is Copyright 
2009, IMS Global Learning Consortium using the Apache License.  We 
expect you to take bits of this software as example code and use it in your 
environment.
</p>
<p>
This web application must be launched from a SimpleLTI client.   We include a
form with hard coded values for the launch.  You can use <a href="launchform.htm">this form</a> to log in to the system and test.  The actual launch point is
at the <a href="launch">/simplelti/launch</a> where simplelti is 
the servlet name.  When you do a launch - it will POST the Simple LTI data
and you should end u pforwarded to  a page that looks like this:

The program also logs into the catalina.out file as it processes the request.
<p>
